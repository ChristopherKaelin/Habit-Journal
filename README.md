# The Habit Journal

***A digital habit tracker, bullet journal and task prioritization/scheduling that mimics the look, feel, and flow of a paper journal.***

## Description 
The Habit Jopurnal is a responsive web application that combines a habit tracker, bullet journal, 
and task manager into one clean, user-friendly dashboard. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

U.S. city, with options to customize quote themes and location preferences.
