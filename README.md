# The Habit Journal

***A digital habit tracker, bullet journal and task prioritization/scheduling that mimics the look, feel, and flow of a paper journal.***

## Description 
The Habit Journal is a responsive web application that combines a habit tracker, bullet journal, 
and task manager into one clean, user-friendly dashboard. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

It fetches a daily inspirational quote from the ZenQuotes API and current weather for a selected 
U.S. city, with options to customize quote themes and location preferences.
