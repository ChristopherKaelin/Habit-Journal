# The Habit Journal

***A digital habit tracker, bullet journal and task prioritization/scheduling that mimics the look, feel, and flow of a paper journal.***

## Description 
    The Habit Jopurnal is a responsive web application that combines a habit tracker, bullet journal, 
    and task manager into one clean, user-friendly dashboard. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
    the app helps users stay focused, track their progress, and reflect daily—all in one place. 
    It fetches a daily inspirational quote from the ZenQuotes API and current weather for a selected 
    U.S. city, with options to customize quote themes and location preferences.
